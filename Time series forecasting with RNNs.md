- use [[Recurrent Neural Networks]] to address a different type of sequence problem: [[Time series]] forecasting
- data show #autocorrelation so you can't just select random data points for train/test splits

[[Autocorrelation at lag L]]

- the [[Recurrent Neural Network Forecaster]] is similar in structure to a more traditional [[AR(L) Model]]
