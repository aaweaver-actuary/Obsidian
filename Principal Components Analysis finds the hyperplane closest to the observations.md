[[Principal Components Analysis]] [[Unsupervised Learning]]

- the first [[Principal Components|principal components]] #loading vector has a very special property:
	- it defines the line in $p$-dimensional space that is closest to the $n$ observations
		- uses average [[l2 Norm]] as distance
- the notion of [[Principal Components|principal components]] as the dimensions that are closest to the $n$ observations extends beyond just the first [[Principal Components|principal component]] 
- the first two [[Principal Components|principal components]] of a data set span the plane that is closest to the $n$ observations in terms of average [[l2 Norm]]
