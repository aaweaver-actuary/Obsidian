[[Survival Analysis]]

[[AUC for Survival Analysis - the C-index]]

## Additional topics[^1]
- Other types of #censored data can work:
	- eg left and interval censoring
- The choice of time scale can be interesting
	- calendar time?
	- age?
- Time-dependent covariates:
	- when we measure a feature (like blood pressure) at different time points
- Methods for checking the proportional [[The Hazard Function|hazard rate]] assumption
- There are also approaches for modeling [[Survival Time|survival time]] data using other #machine-learning methods such as [[Random Forests|random forests]], [[Boosting|boosting]], and [[Neural Networks|neural networks]]
	- Some of these even avoid the proportional [[The Hazard Function|hazard rate]] assumption
