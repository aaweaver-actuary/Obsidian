- [[Convolutional Neural Networks]] builds up an image in a hierarchical fashion
	- first, it tries to ID little shapes or color splotches or edges in the image
		- eg it starts with very small features
	- edges and shapes are recognized and pieced together to form more complex shapes, eventually assembling the target image
	- this hierarchical construction is achieved using [[Convolution Layer|convolution layers]] and [[Pooling Layers in a Convolutional Neural Network|pooling layers]]
