The Gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function $f$ is the [[Vector Field|vector field]] $\nabla f$ whose value at the point $p$ is in the direction of fastest increase:$$
\nabla f(p) = \left[ \begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(p) \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}(p) \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(p)
\end{array}
\right] \hspace{15em}
$$
