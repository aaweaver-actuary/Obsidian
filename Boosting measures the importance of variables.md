- For [[Bagging|bagged]]/[[Random forests|random forest]] #regression #trees, we record the total amount that the #RSS is decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all $B$ #trees
	- A large value indicates an important predictor
- Do a similar thing by averaging the total amount the [[Gini Index]] is decreased by splits over a given predictor, averaged over all $B$ #trees
