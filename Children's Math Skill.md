#### Tips
1. When you teach young children math, start with [[Number Sense|number sense]]
2. Play board games to promote development of [[Number Sense|number sense]]
3. 8-10 years old -- teach child [[Fractions]] --
	- this will make everything else easier
	- key to middle & high school math

- Math skill is one of the few interventions that has a long-term impact on a child's life
- A boost at the onset of basic number abilities will last a long time

#### Basics of mathematical development
- many can be accelerated with practice
	- eg 2 year old can count to 10
- most 4yo can enumerate up to 5 items & 1 item + 1 item = 2 items
- 5yo -- small number addition
	- play games with child 
		- how many fingers?
		- 3! then 4! what if I put them together? 7!
	- at this age also get an idea of numbers/numerals
	- memorization and recall become more central to math than the concrete operations that formed the initial foundation of reasoning
- there can be some issues making the transition from counting ops to symbolic ops
	- can be avoided with a strong [[Number Sense|number sense]]
