[[Unsupervised Learning]] [[Clustering]]

- in **$k$-Means Clustering** we seek to partition the observations into a pre-specified ($k$) number of [[Clustering|clusters]]
- there is some connection between [[Principal Components Analysis (PCA)]] and $k$-Means [[Clustering]]:
	- the segmented subgroups tend to be those with high [[Variance|variance]] relative to each other
