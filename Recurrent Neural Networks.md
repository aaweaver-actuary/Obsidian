[[Motivation for recurrent neural networks]]

[[Recurrent Neural Network Architecture]]
- the #hidden-layer is a sequence of vectors $A_t$, receiving as input $X_{\ell}$ as well as $A_{\ell - 1}$ 
	- $A_{\ell}$ produces an output $O_{\ell}$
- the same #weights $\mathbf{W}$, $\mathbf{U}$, and $\mathbf{B}$ are used at each step in the sequence
	- hence the term #recurrent
- the $A_{\ell}$ sequence represents an evolving model for the response that is updated as each element $X_{\ell}$ is processed
