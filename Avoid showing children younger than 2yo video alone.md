- 1999 & 2011 -> specific recommendation [[American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)|AAP]]
	- if younger than 2yo, avoid TV and other entertainment media
- at this age they are spending a ton of time asleep, eating, etc
	- big concern that video screens crowd out any remaining time for better interactions

- many hours per day -> negative effects
- in moderation (not every day) probably fine
	- used as a video pacifier

#### Educational TV
- <2yo, essentially no evidence this works
	- even at a very basic level
	- children at this age can learn things, just not from TV for some reason

#### Big exception:
- if a real adult "teacher" uses the video as a "prop", can be helpful
- you have to be there acting as a teacher
