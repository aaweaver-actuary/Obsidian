[[Convex sets]] useful for [[Optimization|optimization]], to help find the global minimum:

1. [[Convex Linear Equality and Inequality Constraints]]
2. [[Second Order (Lorentz) Cone Constraints]]
3. [[Definition of positive semi-definite|Semi-definite]] constraints (for matrix variables)
4. [[Polyhedral Sets Are Convex]] ( intersection of half spaces )

- Using these as building blocks often guarantees a [[Convex sets|convex feasible set]], saving the need for a separate convexity check each time
