1. **Mean Squared Error ( #mse ) from Logistic Regression**
2. **Mutual Information**
3. **Variable Importance from Ensemble Models (e.g., Random Forest)**
4. **Correlation Coefficients (Pearson/Spearman)**
5. **AUC-ROC**
6. **ANOVA (for categorical features)**
7. **Chi-Squared Test (for categorical features)**
8. **L1 Regularization (e.g., LASSO)**
9. **Gain or Lift**
10. **Relief Algorithm**

**If you were only allowed to use a single test:** Mutual Information might be the best choice, as it can capture both linear and nonlinear relationships and works with both numerical and categorical features. It provides a general sense of how much information about the binary target is contained within each feature.
