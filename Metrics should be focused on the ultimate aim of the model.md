## from ChatGPT

1. Mean Squared Error [[Mean Squared Error (MSE)|MSE]] from [[Logistic Regression]]
2. Mutual Information
3. Variable Importance from Ensemble Models (e.g., [[Random Forests|random forest]])
4. Correlation Coefficients (Pearson/Spearman)
5. AUC-ROC
6. ANOVA (for categorical features)
7. Chi-Squared Test (for categorical features)
8. L1 [[Regularization]] (e.g., [[The Lasso for regularization|Lasso]])
9. Gain or Lift
10. Relief Algorithm

**If you were only allowed to use a single test:** Mutual Information might be the best choice, as it can capture both linear and nonlinear relationships and works with both numerical and categorical features. It provides a general sense of how much information about the binary target is contained within each feature.
