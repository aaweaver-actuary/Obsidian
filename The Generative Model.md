A mixture of [[Gaussian|Gaussians]] is best described in terms of the generative model:
1. Generate a discrete variable that determines which of the component [[Gaussian|Gaussians]] to use
2. Generate an observation from the chosen distribution

[[In the case of one Gaussian per class, a linear decision boundary is the best one can do]]
[[In the case of tightly clustered Gaussians a linear decision boundary is not optimal]]
