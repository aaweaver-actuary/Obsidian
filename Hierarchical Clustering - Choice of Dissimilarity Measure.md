[[Unsupervised Learning]] [[Hierarchical Clustering]]

- so far have used [[l2 Norm|l2 distance]]
- an alternative is a [[Correlation|correlation]] based distance:
	- considers two observations to be similar if their features are highly correlated
- this is an unusual use of [[Correlation|correlation]], which is normally computed between variables
	- here it is computed between the observation profiles for each pair of observations
