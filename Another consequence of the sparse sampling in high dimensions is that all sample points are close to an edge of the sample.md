Consider $N$ data points uniformly distributed in a $p$-dimensional unit ball centered at the origin, and consider a [[k-Nearest Neighbors|nearest neighbor estimate]] at the origin
- the median distance from the origin to the closest data point is given by:
  $$
  d(p,N) = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2}^{1/N} \right)^{1/p}
  $$
