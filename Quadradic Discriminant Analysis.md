$$
\delta_k(x) = -\frac{1}{2} (x-\mu_k)^T \Sigma_k^{-1} (x-\mu_k) - \frac{1}{2} \log |\Sigma_k| + \log \pi_k
$$

- the [[Decision Boundary|decision boundary]] is quadratic in $x$
- because the $\Sigma_k$ are different for each class, the [[Decision Boundary|decision boundary]] is nonlinear /the quadratic terms matter in a way they don't for [[Linear Discriminant Analysis|linear discriminant analysis]] [^1]
