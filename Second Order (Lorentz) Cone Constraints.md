- Generalizes a [[Convex Linear Equality and Inequality Constraints|linear inequality constraint]]
    - Can represent rotated quadratic inequalities

Can be defined as:$$
\sqrt{\sum_{i=2}^n x_i^2} \le x_1
$$or in vector form:$$
||\mathbf{x}\_{2:n}||\_2 \le x_1, \text{ where } \mathbf{x} =[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]

$$The set defined by these conditions is [[Convex sets|convex]].
