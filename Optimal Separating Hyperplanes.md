#svm #statistical-learning 

This is a direct way to approach the #binary #target problem:
we try to find a #hyperplane that separates the classes in #feature space ( #separating-hyperplane )

If we can't we get creative in two ways:

1. we soften what we mean by "separates"
2. we enrich and enlarge the #feature space so that separation is possible

[[hyperplane|What is a hyperplane?]]

[[Separating hyperplanes]]

[[Maximal margin classifier - the separating hyperplane that makes the biggest gap between the two classes]]
