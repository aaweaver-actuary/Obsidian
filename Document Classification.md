#statistical-learning #neural-network 

- Will use the [[IMDB Movie Reviews Corpus]]
- #sentiment classification task
- [[Featurization - Bag of Words]]
- In the case of a model using the #bag-of-words-model , simpler #lasso #logistic-regression works as well as a 2-layer #neural-network in this case
	- they use #glmnet to fit the #lasso model
	- #glmnet is very effective here because it can exploit #sparse matrices
