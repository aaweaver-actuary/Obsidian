1. prediction accuracy vs interpretability
       - [[Linear Regression|Linear regression]] is highly interpretable
       \* [[Random Forests|Random Forests]] is not interpretable

2. underfitting vs overfitting
       - [[Linear Regression|Linear regression]] is prone to underfitting
       \* [[Random Forests|Random forests]] is prone to [[Overfitting|overfitting]]

3. parsimony vs complexity
        * [[Linear Regression|Linear regression]] is parsimonious
        * [[Random Forests|Random forests]] is complex
        \* often we prefer a simpler model if it is nearly as good as a more complex model
