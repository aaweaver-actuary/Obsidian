#statistical-learning 

1. #prediction-accuracy  vs #interpretability 
    - #linear-regression is highly interpretable
    * #random-forest  is not interpretable

2. #underfitting vs #overfitting 
    - #linear-regression is prone to #underfitting
    * #random-forest is prone to #overfitting

3. #parsimony vs #complexity
     * #linear-regression is parsimonious
     * #random-forest is complex
     * often we prefer a simpler model if it is nearly as good as a more complex model
