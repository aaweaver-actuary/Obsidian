# [[Linear Discriminant Analysis]]

- Here the approach is to model the distribution of $X$ in each of the response classes separately, and then use Bayes' theorem to flip these around into estimates for $Pr(Y=k|X=x)$.
- When we use the [[Gaussian|Gaussian distribution]] for each class, we get [[Linear Discriminant Analysis|linear discriminant analysis]] or #quadratic-discriminant-analysis (QDA).
- This approach is quite general, and can be used with any distributional assumptions for $X$, though we will focus on the [[Gaussian]] case.
