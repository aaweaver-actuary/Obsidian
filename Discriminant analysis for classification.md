# #discriminant-analysis

- Here the approach is to model the #distribution of $X$ in each of the response classes separately, and then use Bayes' theorem to flip these around into estimates for $Pr(Y=k|X=x)$.
- When we use the #normal-distribution / #Gaussian for each class, we get #linear-discriminant-analysis (LDA) or #quadratic-discriminant-analysis (QDA).
- This approach is quite general, and can be used with any distributional assumptions for $X$, though we will focus on the #Gaussian case.
