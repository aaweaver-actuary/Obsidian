- similar to that for [[Convex functions]]
- a set $S$ of constraints forms a convex set if for any two points $x, y \in S$ the line segment connecting them also lies within $S$
    - eg for all $\lambda \in [0,1]$,
        $$
        \lambda x + (1 - \lambda)y \in S \hspace{15em}
        $$
- this property ensures that if you are working on an [[Optimization|optimization]] problem where you are optimizing a [[Convex functions|convex function]] over a convex set, you will find a global minimum

[[The intersection of convex sets is itself convex]]
