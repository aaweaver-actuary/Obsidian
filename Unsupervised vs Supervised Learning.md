- [[Supervised Learning|Supervised learning]] refers to the fact that there is a target 
	- we have features used to try to predict the target 
	- the target *supervises* the learning
- Most of this course focuses on [[Supervised Learning|supervised learning]] methods such as [[Regression|regression]] and [[Classification|classification]] 
- In that setting we have both a set of features $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$ for each object, as well as a response or outcome variable $Y$
	- The goal is then to predict $Y$ using $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$
- Here we instead focus on [[Unsupervised Learning]], where we observe only the features $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$
	- We are **not interested in** prediction 
	- We don't even have an associated response $Y$
