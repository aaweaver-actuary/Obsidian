[[Linear Algebra]]

A square matrix $A$ is positive semi definite if all its [[Definition of eigenvalues|eigenvalues]] are non-negative and for any non-zero vector $x$, $x^TAx\ge0$

### In optimization

If the Hessian matrix is positive semi definite, you are dealing with a [[Convex functions|convex function]] and can find a global minimum
