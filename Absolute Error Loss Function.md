#### Function:

$L_1$ loss: $L(Y, f(X)) = \left|Y - f(X)\right|$

#### Solution:

$\hat{f}(x) = \text{median}(Y|X=x)$

##### Properties:
- the estimates $\hat{f}(x)$ are more robust than those for [[Squared Error Loss Function|the conditional mean]]
- $L_1$ criteria have discontinuities in their derivatives
