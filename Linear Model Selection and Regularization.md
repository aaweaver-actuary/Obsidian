* recall the [[Linear Model|linear model]] $Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+\cdots+\beta_pX_p+\epsilon$ 
* in the lectures covering [[Moving Beyond Linearity|chapter 7 of the text]], we generalize the linear model to accommodate nonlinearity, but still additive relationships between the features and the response 
* in the lectures covering chapter 8 we consider even more general nonlinear models
