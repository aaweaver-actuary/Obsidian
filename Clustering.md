- a technique for [[Unsupervised Learning]]
- **Clustering** refers to a very broad set of techniques for finding subgroups, or **clusters** in a data set
- we seek a partition of the data into distinct subgroups so that the observations within each group are quite similar to each other
- we need a definition of what it means for two or more observations to be similar or different
	- this is often a domain-specific consideration that must be made based on knowledge of the data being studied
