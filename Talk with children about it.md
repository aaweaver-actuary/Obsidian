- When a child is upset/irrational about a conflict with someone, don't avoid the topic
	- These are exactly the time when the child is most aware of a particular set of emotions
	- And most ready to learn about them
	- And most willing to change behaviors
- [[Authoritative Parenting]] concept is called to mind
- Talk with child about:
	1. what you think should happen
	2. why you think it should happen
		- helps with [[Empathy|empathy-based]] reasoning
