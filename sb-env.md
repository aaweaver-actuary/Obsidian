- data process I am writing:
	1. route each column into 1 of 6 types:
		1. binary
		2. categorical
		3. finite numeric
		4. other numeric
		5. date
		6. object
	2. have a fixed set of [[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)|EDA]] statistics and tests to give an ordering of the columns in terms of their likely predictiveness
