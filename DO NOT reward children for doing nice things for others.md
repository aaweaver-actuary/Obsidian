- In this particular case, in the long run, teaching kids to be nice in order to obtain a reward will get in the way of the natural [[Empathy|empathy]] and [[Pro-Social Behaviors|pro-social]] tendencies children already have
- It is natural for a child to engage in [[Pro-Social Behaviors|pro-social behaviors]]
	- if you reward them:
		1. they will try to do more of them
		2. they will change how they think about [[Pro-Social Behaviors|pro-social behaviors]]
			- child is more likely to be good when you are around, less likely to be good when you aren't
				- they are motivated by the reward
- Extrinsic rewards tend to overwhelm intrinsic rewards

- to promote [[Pro-Social Behaviors|pro-social behaviors]], offer an environment that models behaviors you want children to maintain
	- WE need to be pro-social
