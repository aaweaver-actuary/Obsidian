[[Unsupervised Learning]] [[Matrix Completion]]

- used when data are missing

## Main problem:
- This ignores the [[Correlation|correlations]] among variables
- We should be able to exploit these correlations for #imputation 
- We also need to assume that values are missing at random
	- Eg the *"missingness"* should not be informative
