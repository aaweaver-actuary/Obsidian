- binary target - hit/not hit
- several of the predictors in the dataset won't be available at the time this model runs
	- try to isolate/find variables that aren't going to depend on whether or not there has been a quote/policy written
	- use econ data from fred
		- decision to purchase is at least partly a function of the general economic environment
		- or maybe economic factors influence the price they are willing to pay?
- using xgboost (probably) assuming it performs the best
	- if there is a time series structure could benefit from NN?
