[[Unsupervised Learning]] [[Hierarchical Clustering]]

- Scaling of the variables matters
	- Should the features be [[Data Standardization|standardized]] in some way?
	- Should they be centered to have mean zero?
	- Should they be scaled to have [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] one?
- In the case of [[Hierarchical Clustering]]:
	- What [[Hierarchical Clustering - Choice of Dissimilarity Measure|dissimilarity measure]] should be used?[^1]
	- What type of [[Hierarchical Clustering - Types of Linkage|linkage]] should be used?[^2]
- How many [[Clustering|clusters]] to choose?
	- Important in both [[k-Means Clustering]] and [[Hierarchical Clustering]]
	- This is difficult
	- There is no agreed-upon method[^4]
- What features should be used to drive the [[Clustering|clustering]]?
