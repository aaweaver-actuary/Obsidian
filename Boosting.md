- From [[Statistical Learning Lectures]]:
	- [[Boosting is a general procedure and idea]]
	- [[Boosting algorithm for regression trees]]
	- [[Boosting works for classification]]
	- [[Boosting requires hyperparameter tuning]]
	- [[Boosting measures the importance of variables]]

## Summary
- [[8. Tree-Based Methods#8.1 Tree-based Methods|decision trees]] are simple and interpretable models for regression and classification
- they are typically not competitive with other methods in terms of prediction accuracy ([[Gradient boosting is the preferred tree-based method]])
- [[Bagging]], [[Random forests]], and boosting are among the state of the art
	- but tough to interpret ([[Predictive accuracy is linked with lack of interpretability]])
