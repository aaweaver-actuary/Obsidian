## Summary
- [[Tree-Based Methods#8.1 Tree-based Methods|decision trees]] are simple and #interpretable-models for [[Regression|regression]] and [[Classification|classification]]
- they are typically not competitive with other methods in terms of [[Prediction Accuracy|prediction accuracy]] 
- [[Gradient boosting is the preferred tree-based method]]
- [[Bagging]], [[Random Forests]], and boosting are among the [[State Of the Art|state of the art]]
	- but tough to [[Predictive accuracy is linked with lack of interpretability|interpret]]
