[[Unsupervised Learning]]

- Not as clear as they are for [[Supervised Learning|supervised learning]] 
- The goal is to discover interesting things about the measurements:
	- is there an informative way to visualize the data?
	- can we discover subgroups among the variables or among the observations?
- We discuss two methods:
	1. [[Principal Components Analysis (PCA)]] - a tool used for data visualization or data pre-processing before [[Supervised Learning|supervised learning]] techniques are applied
	2. [[Clustering]] - a broad class of methods for discovering unknown subgroups in data
