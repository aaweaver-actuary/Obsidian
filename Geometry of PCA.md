[[Unsupervised Learning]] [[Principal Components Analysis (PCA)]]

- The loading vector $\phi_1$ with elements $\phi_{11}, \phi_{21}, \dots, \phi_{p1}$ defines a direction in feature space along which the data vary the most
- If we project the $n$ data points $x_1, \dots, x_n$ onto this direction, the projected values are the [[Principal Components|principal component]] scores $z_{11}, \dots, z_{n1}$ themselves:
