- potential problems caused by excessive play
- Lots of educational games that are very good
	- some non-educational related to decreased achievement/attention span

[[Negative effects from lots of video game play]]

## Tips:
1. note how much time your child spends on other worthwhile activities before and after starting video games
	- eg HW, reading, exercise
	- try to maintain the amount of time spent on good stuff as much as possible
	- if the games cut into TV time (or other junk activity), not much of a reason to be concerned
