[[Unsupervised Learning]]

- [[Principal Components Analysis|Principal components analysis]] produces a low-dimensional representation of a dataset
	- finds a sequence of [[Linear Combination|linear combinations]] of the variables that have maximal [[Variance|variance]] and are mutually uncorrelated
- Apart from producing derived features for use in [[Supervised Learning|supervised learning]] problems, [[Principal Components Analysis|principal components analysis]] also serves as a tool for data visualization
