[[Sometimes a linear boundary can fail in a SVM]]

- [[One way to overcome a failed linear boundary in a SVM is to enlarge the features by adding transformations of existing features]]
	- usually add polynomial terms
	- these can get pretty big pretty fast, especially as you introduce higher-order terms
- [[The more elegant and controlled way to overcome a failed linear decision boundary in a SVM is through kernels]]
