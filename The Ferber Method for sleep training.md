# Not appropriate for
- Children under [[6 months of age]]

## Summary of the method
1. Take steps to prepare the baby to sleep.
	- This includes night-time rituals and day-time activities.
2. At bedtime, leave the child in bed and leave the room.
3. Return at *progressively increasing intervals* to comfort the baby, but do not pick them up.
	- For example, on the first night, some scenarios call for returning first after three minutes, then after five minutes, and thereafter each ten minutes, until the baby is asleep.
	- 3 minutes $\rightarrow$ 5 minutes $\rightarrow$ 10 minutes
4. Each subsequent night, return at intervals longer than the night before.
	- For example, the second night may call for returning first after five minutes, then after ten minutes, and thereafter each twelve minutes, until the baby is asleep.
