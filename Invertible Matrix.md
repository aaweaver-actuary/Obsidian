[[Linear Algebra]]

- An $n\times n$ square matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is called *invertible* if there is an $n\times n$ square matrix $\mathbf{B}$ such that $\mathbf{AB} = \mathbf{BA} = \mathbf{I}_n$  
	- $\mathbf{I}_n$ - $n\times n$ [[Identity Matrix|identity matrix]]
	- Multiplication uses is ordinary [[Matrix Multiplication|matrix multiplication]]
	- $\mathbf{B}$ is uniquely determined by $\mathbf{A}$ and is called the [[Inverse Matrix|inverse]] of $\mathbf{A}$, denoted by $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ 

### Properties:
- Over a [[Field|field]], a square matrix that is not invertible is called [[Singular Matrix|singular]] or [[Degenerate Matrix|degenerate]]
