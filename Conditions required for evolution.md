1. Self-replication
2. blueprint for replication
	- [[Genome]] = information
	- dna/rna = chem storage mechanism
3. inherit blueprint
	- parent -> offspring
	- when creating a child, copy some of the genome from one parent, some of the genome from the other to produce genome of child
4. random mutations
	- every now and then a gene will have a few differences from parent
	- usually 1 bit/1000
5. selection
	- who gets/doesn't get to reproduce?
	- find food/shelter
	- avoid injury/getting eaten
	- must find mate
