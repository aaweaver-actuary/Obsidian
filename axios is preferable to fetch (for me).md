[[JavaScript]] [[Node.js]]

In the context of your work, both [[JavaScript fetch|fetch]] and [[axios]] can perform [[HTTP Requests|HTTP requests]]. Here's why you might consider using [[axios]]:

1. **Automatic JSON Parsing**: [[Axios automatically converts response data to JSON, so no need to call response.json() as with fetch]].
2. **Built-in Request and Response Interceptors**: This can be useful for adding tokens to headers or handling global response errors.
3. **Cancel Requests**: [[Axios provides a more straightforward way to cancel requests, which can be beneficial in specific scenarios]].
4. **Wider Browser Support**: [[Axios can be preferable as it includes built-in polyfills, leading to wider browser support.]]
5. **More Detailed Error Handling**: [[Axios provides more information in the error object which might be useful in debugging.]]

Considering your profile, using [[axios]] might lead to a slightly more concise and clear code, especially if any of the above points align with your needs. However, [[JavaScript fetch|fetch]] is generally lighter and doesn't require an additional library, which can be an advantage if these specific features are not required for your project. In your case, I'd recommend using [[axios]] if any of the mentioned features are beneficial for the task at hand; otherwise, sticking with [[JavaScript fetch|fetch]] should be fine.
