* here we apply [[Principal Components Analysis (PCA)|principal components analysis]] to define the [[Linear Combination|linear combinations]] of the predictors, for use in our [[Regression|regression]] model
* the first [[Principal Components|principal component]] that is that (normalized) [[Linear Combination|linear combination]] of the variables that has the largest [[Variance|variance]]
    * the second [[Principal Components|principal component]] has largest [[Variance|variance]] out of all [[Linear Combination|linear combinations]] that are uncorrelated with the first [[Principal Components|principal component]]
    * and so on
* hence with many [[Correlation|correlated]] original variables, we replace them with a small set of [[Principal Components|principal components]] that capture their joint variation

[[Partial Least Squares]]
