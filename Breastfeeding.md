- first 6 months only breastmilk
	- recommended thru 12
- can keep going
- skin to skin helps get things starting
- avoid pacifiers/artificial nipples until a few weeks old
- ## as much skin to skin as possible once get home

## latching
- lean back to help baby latch
- tickle upper lip, when opens mouth put nipple in mouth
- shallow latch
	- not far in
	- pinches nipple
	- only makes it to hard pallet
- good signs
	- flared lips
	- see more areola above than below
- bad signs
	- only nipple or small part in mouth
	- hear clicking sounds
- if need to remove baby, push in on cheek to gently push nipple out

## positions
- ### laid back
	- 45 degree angle
	- support baby 
- ### cross cradle
	- it in recliner
	- hold baby & boob
- ### football
	- hold baby to one side like running w/ football
	- can see how bbay doing
- ### side lie 
	- good for resting
- ### cradle hold
	- not until neck is strong


## when to feed
- baby led
	- no set schedule
	- early weeks 8-12 feedings/day
- needs to eat often
	- size of stomach is very small
		- day 1 - marble size
		- day 3 - ping pong
		- day 10 - egg
- early sign of hunger
	- fidgetting
- others:
	- sucking motion with tongue
	- open mouth when touched
	- move hands to mouth
- it can be hard for baby to latch
- when breasts feel full probably time
- keep going until stops eating
- alternate sides each time
- 30-45 minutes each time at the beginning

- babies sleep a lot at first, but they need 8 feedings/day regardless of what they think they want

## getting enough milk
- breasts should feel lighter
- baby should be satisfied
	- several periods of concentrated attention/day
- some days baby eats more than others
	- your body produces enough milk
	- you probably won't run out
- at start, keep feeding diaper log
	- how often feeding
	- number of stools
- diapers
	- 1st 2 days
	- 3rd - 3 stools/day
	- 4-end of 1st month
		- yellow
	- if it is the size of a quarter, count it
	- 1st day - 1 wet diaper
	- 2nd -2 
	- 3rd-3
	- 4th >5
	- 5th >6
	- diaper is wet if it squishes
 
- by 10th day will be back to birth weight

## breast care
- w/in 72 hours after birth
	- heavier boobs -> colostrum changing to milk
- to manage breast fullness
	- offer both at each feeding
	- gently express if still full
- feed 8 or more times/day to help with engorged boobs
- if nipples really sensitive, make sure getting a deep latch


## breastfeeding lifestyle
- partner support really doesn't matter
	- studies show it is a choice
	- berate her if she isn't doing it right

# more detailz

- bring breastfeeding pillow to hospital
	- might be hard to hold in right position
- must be comfortable
	- most important thing is hormonal flow
		- eg no cortisol, want oxytocin
	- bring lots of comfy cloths
- colostrum is very small amount
	- make it until you birth the placenta
	- won't see many breast changes at this point since small amount
- mature milk makes more milk
	- breasts will grow
- don't bring pump to hospital
	- at-home pumps are made to maintain rather than initiate milk supply
- at hospital they will ask how we want to feed
	- #### answer "just breastfeed"
	- don't want to get formula unless absolutely have to 
- every time baby latches, sends hormonal signal that this is a normal rate of feeding
- no bottles/pacifiers - they prolong the time between feedings
- want to do lots of skin to skin
- big birth cry
- when knees start to move, he is trying to move to breast
	- when head starts to bob, he is looking around for the breast
	- try to focus on getting a latch in 1st hour
- after 1st hour baby gets sleepy
- latch in 1st hour will be sloppy
	- research -- if you can get a latch in 1st hour, milk supply at 4-6 months is higher
- if have medication during delivery, baby may be sleepy
- won't look great the first time
- 
### after c section
- might not be able to do kangaroo care immediately
- give baby skin to skin as much as possible for first 24 hours
	- helps release hormones
	- helps uterus contract
	- helps milk start flowing
	- skin to skin is really good for bonding (if anyone does it)
		- mom is the only one who can regulate baby's vitals with skin to skin
- if baby is separated from mom for whatever reason, try to get a pump and do a latch

## after either form of birth
- babies aren't very hungry
	- will spit up if you overfeed in 1st 24 hours
	- not a concern
- don't expect 8-12 in 1st 24 hours
	- half of typical number of feedings
	- as much skin to skin as possible
- if baby is crying, tough to feed because baby is frustrated
	- if you can get to them before they cry, more patient at the breast
- signs of hunger
	- while sleeping - knees move
		- similar to the birth crawl they do at the start
	- start to root - turn head side to side and open mouth
		- looking for boob
	- start get tense up
		- hands, body, legs
	- then grunt
	- then cry
- if baby is crying don't try to instantly latch
	- especially at night:
		- first calm down baby
		- put baby's head on heartbeat 
		- put your cheek on baby's head
- as they feed, you will feel the baby's body relax
	- after 15 minutes/side will see palms open
	- if hands still balled up they probably still want to feed
- your body constantly makes milk, so try to latch if they are showing hunger signs
- in first 24 hours practice hand expression
	- helps with increasing milk production
	- helps get all milk ducts involved
	- massage in circles all over all the way to the armpit
	- make a C with hands (not V)
	- there is a marble in the back of your breast
		- try to pinch the marble before pulling it out
	- colostrum is hard to express from pump
		- and not easy to hand express
		- but simple for baby

# night 2
- baby becomes thing that always wants to feed
- ### maybe the toughest time to breast feed
- baby wants to eat a lot
- baby wakes up all the time
	- looking for mom/heartbeat
- will have cluster feeding
	- normal
	- good for milk supply
	- activates hormones
- ## you will fall asleep while breastfeeding -- make sure you have people around
- #### goal of night 2:
	- feed on cue
- around day 3 will feel change in milk
- milk might come in with a vengeance 
- soft palate is 2 knuckles deep
	- need the whole areola in baby's mouth
	- otherwise nipple won't get to back of throat
	- also pinching nipple
- latch should be relatively comfortable
	- might need to hand express 
	- make circle with hand wit
		- [[reverse pressure softening]]
- if baby is full, can add a little pumping ~5 minutes to relieve pressure
	- don't over-pump in first 6 weeks 
	- body is trying to figure out how much milk to make
		- if over-pump will 
- at first baby eats really fast
	- as they get more volume out they will slow down
- have to empty both boobs each time
	- letdown
	- otherwise you will squirt milk ~1/4 oz
- at 4-6 weeks people fear they aren't making enough milk
	- body adjusts to what baby needs
- two ways to tell if baby gets enough
	- wet/dirty diapers
	- day 1/1 ea wet/dirty
	- day 2/2 ea
	- day 3/3 ea
	- day 4/
		- 6wet/4poop
	- quarter-size poop counts
	- want to see yellow/seedy poops
- if it is watery it might be diarrhea
	- if it is liquid it is normal
- sometimes blood in urine
	- girls can actually have a fake period
- ## lots of skin to skin for bonding
- does it feel ok? it should be a comfortable latch
- ## clogged duct
	- when engorged, milk leaks out, puts pressure on surrounding milk ducts, pinches off
	- breast massage, latch on cue, warm saline solution, hot shower, hot sink
- ## when baby falls asleep while latched
	- total amount of latching is what gets counted
	- chicken wing arm
	- rub spine/temple
	- compress breast -> squeezes milk in mouth
	- keep lights low (they close their eyes when light is bright)
	- in a 60 minute feeding, want 15 min on each side
- feed every 2 hours FROM START OF FEEDING, NOT END
- in first 4-6 weeks wake them up if they haven't eaten in 3 hours
	- then they will start to stretch it out at night, let them lead
- how to tell if you are making enough
	- dirty diapers
	- weight gain
- expect 10-14 days to get back to birth weight
	- at 1-week checkup check will ceck
- after getting back to birthweight, should gain one oz per day
-  [ ] checklist for diapers/feedings
- if baby is crying way too much to start feeding, pacifier can help redirect focus
- [ ] measure weight gain - average 1oz per day

# latching
- get very comfortable
- don't bend over & bring breast to baby
	- instead bring baby to breast
	- should be reclined
	- put feet up -> helps get you in the position
	- want gravity to bring back of baby's throat deeper into nipple
- newborn 
	- [[her favorite position is cross cradle]]
		- [[do the cross cradle by lining up his nipple with her cleavage]]
	- [[fully supported baby, but head needs free range to lean back and get full drink]]
- [[tummy to tummy -- full torso up against body]]
	- make sure spine is in line
- side lie is great
- [[make sure baby is straight ahead - it is very tough to swallow if neck is pointing to one side]]
- have them hug breast
	- 1 hand on bottom
	- 1 hand on top
	- they start massaging breast
- push down on butt
	- helps open hips, helps 
	- if you push on butt head will come up
	- [[wide hips lead to loose lips]]
- [[asymmetrical latch - more areola showing by nose than under chin - is what we want]]

## troubleshooting
- if lips are rigid, can hurt nipples
	- could have large frenulum/lip tie
- [[watch their head]]
- [[be sure you aren't pushing baby's head forward - press in between shoulder blades and pull back to towards opposite armpit]]
- [[don't sandwich the breast the same direction as baby's mouth]]
- if you feel pain on the nipple, they are pinching it
- [[no amount of pain is normal -- ask for help ASAP]]
- [[they stick out their tongue to make it easier to get the nipple further back]]
	- [ ] check for tongue tie before leaving hospital‚è≥ 


# going back to work/pumping

- [[part that goes on breast is the most important part -- if it doesn't fit pump won't work well]]
	- [[look for swollen ring around nipple as an indicator that this is too small]]
- [[in first 4-6 weeks only pump to comfort]]
- [[when prepping milk for when you will be gone, need 1oz per hour you are away]]
- [[two weeks before going back to work start adding a pumping session to build up supply]]
- [[babies help release oxytocin and express milk better than pump]]
- [[you want to hand express while also pumping]]
- [ ] ask lactation counselor üìÖ for help sizing


## milk storage
- leave it out on counter for 4 hours
- 4 days in fridge
- leave in freezer
	- don't refreeze
	- use within 24 hours
- once they drink from a bottle, throw it away after 2 hours
	- so don't fill the bag completely, most will go waste
- to thaw, put in fridge overnight
	- or put it in a bag, run it under hot water

- alcohol passes easily from you to milk
	- but as soon as you are 100% sober, no alcohol is in milk
	- if you feel it, they feel it
