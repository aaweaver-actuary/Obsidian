Vectors are linearly independent if no vector can be written as a [[Linear Combination|linear combination]] of the other vectors

Vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n$ are linearly independent if the only solution to the equation$$
\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \mathbf{v}_i = \ \vec{0} \hspace{15em}
$$is $c_1=c_2=\cdots=c_n=0$
