If you have constraints like $Ax = b$ or $Ax \le b$, the set of $x$ that satisfy them is a convex set

#### For $Ax=b$
- $Ax=b$ forms a [[Hyperplane]], which is a [[Convex sets|convex set]]

#### For $Ax \le b$
- The solution set of $Ax \le b$ forms a half space, which is also a [[Convex sets|convex set]]
