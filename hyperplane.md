A hyperplane in $p$ dimensions is a flat [[Affine Space|affine subspace]] of dimension $p-1$

General form of a hyperplane:

$$
\begin{equation}
\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 +\cdots + \beta_pX_p=0
\end{equation}
$$

- In $p=2$ dimensions a hyperplane is a linear function
- If $\beta_0=0$ the hyperplane goes through the origin
    - otherwise it does not
- The vector $\vec{\beta} = (\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_p)$ is called the [[Normal Vector|normal vector]]
    - it points in a direction orthogonal to the surface of a hyperplane
    - note this excludes $\beta_0$ - it goes through the origin
- In the special case where $\vec{\beta}$ is a [[A unit vector has norm 1|unit vector]] the orthogonal projection onto the hyperplane is just the [[l2 Norm|l2 norm]]
