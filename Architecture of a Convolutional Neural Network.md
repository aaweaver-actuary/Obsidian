#### example CNN architecture:

![[Typical-CNN-Architecture-1536x562.png]]

- many #convolution-layers and #pooling-layers 
- start with image
- convolve, pool, convolve, pool
- each #convolutional-filter creates a new channel in a #convolution-layers 
- as #pooling-layers reduce size, the number of filters/channels is typically increased
