#### example [[Convolutional Neural Networks]] architecture:

![[Typical-CNN-Architecture-1536x562.png]]

- many [[Convolution Layer|convolution layers]] and [[Pooling Layers in a Convolutional Neural Network|pooling layers]]
- start with image
- convolve, pool, convolve, pool
- each [[Convolutional Filter]] creates a new channel in a [[Convolution Layer|convolution layers]] 
- as [[Pooling Layers in a Convolutional Neural Network|pooling layers]] reduce size, the number of filters/channels is typically increased
