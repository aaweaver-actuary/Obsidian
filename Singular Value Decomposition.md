This is a [[Linear Algebra|linear algebra]] technique that decomposes a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ into three other matrices $U$, $\Sigma$, $V^*$:

1. $U$ - unitary $m\times m$ matrix (orthogonal in real space)
2. $\Sigma$ - $m\times n$ diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers, known as singular values
3. $V^*$ - conjugate transpose of an $n \times n$ unitary matrix $V$

So $\mathbf{A} = U\Sigma V^*$
