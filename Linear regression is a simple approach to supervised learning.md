#linear-regression 
- we assume a model:  
    * $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$
    * $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are unknown constants representing the #intercept and #slope terms in the #linear-model
        * also known as the model #coefficient's or #parameter's
    * $\epsilon$ is a #random-error term
* given some estimates $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$ for the model coefficients, we predict future sales using:  
    * $\hat{y} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} x$
    * $\hat{y}$ is a #prediction for $Y$ given the value of $X=x$
    * the #hat-symbol, $\hat{.}$, is used to denote an estimated value

[[Linear regression parameters are estimated by least squares]]
