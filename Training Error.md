the training error is the [[Mean Squared Error (MSE)|mean error]] that results from using a statistical learning method to predict the response on the same observations that were used in training the method
- the training error rate often is quite different from the [[Testing Error|testing error rate]], and in particular the former can dramatically underestimate the latter[^1]
